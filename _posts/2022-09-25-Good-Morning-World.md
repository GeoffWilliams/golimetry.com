# Heading Level 1 is Posting to Jekyll via JekyllEx and a Markdown Editor

## Heading Level 2

- Open JekyllEx
- Open repo
- Make new post
- For new post filename:
2022-0D-0M-post-name.md

Eg for 25th Sept post called "Good Morning World" the post name is:

2022-25-09-Good-Morning-World.md
(Ensure the post name has .md extension)

Write the markdown in Joplin, StackIO, or even just in JekyllEx. You can preview Markdown in JekyllEx.
I put the Markdown Cheat Sheet in Joplin and I think it's in stack. Joplin should do the job tho.

Copy the markdown to JekyllEx.

Be careful of using dashes or hyphens or other markdown formatting symbols.

Then press the <> button on the top right to set the post metadata.

For a post use this metadata

layout: post
title: "Post Name"

Then press the commit button (top right, second from left, ie to the left of the <> button). 

For editing elsewhere, pull commits after they've been edited on phone so the repo is the same on all devices.

that's it !
