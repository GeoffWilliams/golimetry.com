Brighton & Hove Albion are an excellent football club.
But how can they keep moving forward, without Graham Potter, the manager who helped them to their best results in the Premier League ? 
How can other clubs, lower and middle-tier table clubs in England, grow, expand, and move ahead in the fiercely competitive Premier League ? 
Brighton - and other English clubs of comparable size - should look to managers with Copa Libertadores, and Copa Sudamericana, experience. (The Copa Sudamericana is the second-tier version of the Copa Libertadores. It is, basically, the South American equivalent of the UEFA Europa League).
So, which managers ? 

- Marcelo Gallardo at River Plate. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDo5rMWF5l4) for a video about Gallardo, from 2019.

- Abel Ferreira at Palmeiras. ([Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFSzKH2JoNU) for a video about Abel Ferreira.

- Jorge Sampaoli, a rising star in Europe, who emerged as a top talent by winning the Copa Sudamericana with Universidad de Chile. (The Copa Sudamericana, is the second-tier version of the Copa Libertadores, i.e. the South American equivalent of the Europa League). He was most recently, the coach at French side Olympic Marseille, and did well there. He's a free agent, right now.

- Gerardo Martino, who saved Newell's Old Boys from relegation, and, then brought them to glory.

Wild cards like Rafael Dudamel, Miguel Ángel Ramírez, or Ismael Rescalvo.

This is the 4th episode of the Golimetry podcast. In detail, it examines international football recruitment, and looks at why managers from South America (and the Copa Libertadores/Copa Sudamericana in particular) are perfect fits for lower and mid-ranked English football clubs. 

Managers with success in CONMEBOL club tournaments, are competitive. They can do well under pressure. They have unique and fresh ideas. These are forced to be creative, as they compete not only with other domestic sides, but sides across South America, and, the world. Managers from South America often emerge from the academies who've developed nearly every top South American footballer in the world right now, having started as academy scouts, coaches or analysts. 

With their recruitment knowledge, they can find the next great South American player, before their price tags soar beyond the club's budget.

If you're a fan of Brighton, or not, there's lots to unpack, and lots to enjoy, in this episode of the Golimetry podcast.
