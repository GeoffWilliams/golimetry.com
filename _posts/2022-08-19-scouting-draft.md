title:  "Scouting test"
---

Your team has just signed a new player, is looking to sign one, is scouting a player or, rumours are that a certain player is coming to your team.
How's he going to do ?
How's he LIKELY to do ? Can that be predicted ? Perhaps, based on his past performances. (Predictive historical scouting)
You want to know who this guy is. You might know, say, what his last team was, but you want to delve deeper, too. What positions has he played ? What can be play ? What academy did he come from ? What players is he similar to ? What players could he BECOME similar to ? What is his potential ?

Eg Julian Alvarez is an Argentine forward. So was Sergio Aguero. Does this mean Alvarez will be the new Aguero ? No. Perhaps he is more like another European player. Perhaps he has traits of Aguero, but maybe he idolises, say, Gabriel Jes√∫s.
