# Heading Level 1 is Posting to Jekyll via JekyllEx and a Markdown Editor

## Heading Level 2

- Open JekyllEx
- Open repo
- Make new post
- For new post filename:
2022-0D-0M-post-name.md

Eg for 25th Sept post called "Good Morning World" the post name is:

2022-25-09-Good-Morning-World.md
(Ensure the post name has .md extension)

Write the markdown in Joplin, StackIO, or even just in JekyllEx. You can preview Markdown in JekyllEx.
I put the Markdown Cheat Sheet in Joplin and I think it's in stack. Joplin should do the job tho.

Copy the markdown to JekyllEx. paste as plain text so formatting isn't carried improperly 

Be careful of using dashes or hyphens or other markdown formatting symbols.

Then press the <> button on the top right to set the post metadata.

For a post use this metadata but remove the 'symbols, so three hyphens above and three below

'---
layout: post
title: "Post Name"
---'

Then press the commit button (top right, second from left, ie to the left of the <> button). 

For editing elsewhere, pull commits after they've been edited on phone so the repo is the same on all devices.

that's it !
